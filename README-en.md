# How to run the microservices ecosystem application?

1. Clone this repository by using the following command

   ```
   https://github.com/KingSatur/java_training-run-configurations.git
   ```

   or, if you use ssh, you can use:

   ```
   git@github.com:KingSatur/java_training-run-configurations.git
   ```

   2. You must download the required microservices to run the docker-compose, in order to ease this task, I provided a .sh file that automatically will download the required microservices for you. You just simple execute the .sh file by executing

   ```
   ./download_components.sh
   ```

   of course, you will have to provide execution permissions to that filo in order to execute it
